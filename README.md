# ac_bhop
### For AssaultCube 1.3.0.2

A cheat to BHop everywhere in AssaultCube.
Works in singleplayer and multiplayer.

# How to compile
Clone the source code to your PC, build in **X86-Release**.
**You will need vcpkg !**

# How to use
After compiling the code yourself (or after downloading it from Releases), inject all DLLs at once.
If for some reason it does not work, then inject every other dlls before injecting the ac_bhop one.

# Vcpkg packages
- glm
- minhook

# Issues
As of now, I haven't found a reliable way to override AC physics with my own code, while replicating it to server.
And because of this, the movements aren't 100% accurate to Source engine movements.
Honestly, it's as simple as holding space and forward key to speed right in front of you.
In the future (if I have time) I hope I'll be able to make a cheat that is 100% accurate to Source engine.

# Side notes
Code is not correctly organised like I wanted to in the first place but it wasnt top priority for me.
I'll work on that later (again, if I have time)
