# ac_bhop

A cheat to BHop everywhere in AssaultCube.
Works in singleplayer and multiplayer.

# How to compile
Clone the source code to your PC, build in **X86-Release**.
**You will need vcpkg !**

# Vcpkg packages
- glm
- minhook

# Issues
As of now, I haven't found a reliable way to override AC physics with my own code, while replicating it to server.
And because of this, the movements aren't 100% accurate to Source engine movements.
Honestly, it's as simple as holding space and forward key to speed right in front of you.
In the future (if I have time) I hope I'll be able to make a cheat that is 100% accurate to Source engine.

# Side notes
Code is not correctly organised like I wanted to in the first place but it wasnt top priority for me.
I'll work on that later (again, if I have time)
